# BandInMuseScore
MIDI accompaniment for MuseScore, automatically generated by [MMA Midi Accompaniment](https://www.mellowood.ca/mma/index.html).

## HowTo
- Install [MMA MIDI Accompaniment](https://www.mellowood.ca/mma/index.html) for your OS (it's Free).
- [Download BandInMuseScore](https://github.com/berteh/BandInMuseScore/archive/master.zip) plugin
- Open your score with chords symbols in MuseScore
- Launch plugin creator, open BandInMuseScore plugin from there, click `run`, it will create MMA file automatically.

Then (for now) generate the mid (MIDI) file of the accompaniment from the command line, and open it in MuseScore (or your usual MIDI player)

``mma ./MMAtemp.mma  & musescore ./MMAtemp.mid``

## Example
Hear for yoursel how the plain few measures of the sample BandInMuseScore sound [better with the default Folk accompaniment](https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/berteh/BandInMuseScore/master/example/BandInMuseScore_with_mma.mp3), in our example directory:

## Roadmap
Please help us for the following... which I may do if I find some time:
- make mma generation from within musescore work (likely groobe library not being found in default setting)
- find a way to import mid file from the plugin API, and (even better) merge it in a copy of the original leadsheet.
- add more MMA styles and grooves to BandInMuseScore.
- improve the quality / features of the generated MMA accompaniment.
